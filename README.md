# Energy-Economics-in-Electricity-Markets

These course materials are developed by [Panagiotis (Panos) Moutis](https://panay1ot1s.com/) under the second part of the graduate course **Energy Economics in Electricity Markets EE G3304** at City College of New York (CCNY).
 

## Description 

- The first part of this course introduces:
  - the electricity market stakeholders (regulators, operators, generating companies, utilities),  
  - the functions of these markets (procuring energy, securing reliability, planning infrastructure) and
  - the evolving policy frameworks.
- In the second part this course defines mathematical models for the cost effective:
  - Dispatch of energy demand,
  - Secure and stable grid operation,
  - Planning of fuel and plant commitment and
  - Grid expansions
- Linear approximations, mixed integer programming and convex relaxations to the AC Optimal Power Flow will
be presented and developed for testing in the MATLAB environment. 

## Notebooks

1. Notebook 1 Economic Dispatch, Unit Commitment, Long-term Energy Planning
2. Notebook 2 Optimal Power Flow problem, DC and Decoupled OPF
3. Notebook 3 Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow & Grid Expansion Planning

There is also an assigment for Economic Dispatch of 15 generators for a 10-hour planning.
